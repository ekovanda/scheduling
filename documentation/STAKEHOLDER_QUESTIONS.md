# Stakeholder Questions - Pending Clarification

## Open Questions

### 1. Intern Minimum Consecutive Nights Rule

**Question:** Should Interns (formerly "TA") follow the same "minimum 2 consecutive nights" rule as TFAs?

**Current Implementation:** Yes, Interns follow the same rule—if scheduled for nights, they must work at least 2 consecutive nights.

**Context:**
- Non-Azubi staff (TFA, Intern) are now required to work a minimum of 2 consecutive nights when assigned night shifts
- This is a hard constraint (must be satisfied, not just optimized)
- Azubis are exempt and can do single nights if necessary

**Options:**
1. **Yes** - Interns follow the 2+ consecutive rule (current implementation)
2. **No** - Interns can work single nights like Azubis
3. **Special rule** - Interns have their own minimum (e.g., 1 or 3)

**Implications:**
- If Yes: Interns need to be available for multiple consecutive days when scheduled
- If No: More flexibility in scheduling, but may disrupt established patterns

**Decision Needed By:** [Date TBD]

**Decision:** _[To be filled in]_
